# Waterfall Workouts

Clone repo
- npm install
- ionic serve (for web)
- npx npm run build && npx cap copy android && npx cap run android (to run on Android device or emulator)
    - Or just use the Ionic VSCode extension, which is very helpful

I don't have the best memory in the world, so when I realized I was trying to manage and track my workouts using a notes app, and forgetting what I had already done that week, this app was conceived. I made it for me, but got it fleshed out enough that anyone can use it. If you're interested in contributing, please feel free.
